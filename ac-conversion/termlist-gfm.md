## <span id="Metadata_structure" class="mw-headline">Metadata structure</span>

**Date:** 23 October, 2013.

**Abstract:** The Audubon Core is a set of vocabularies designed to
represent metadata for biodiversity multimedia resources and
collections. It aims to represent information that will help to
determine whether a particular resource or collection will be fit for
some particular biodiversity science application before acquiring the
media. Among others, the vocabularies address such concerns as the
management of the media and collections, descriptions of their content,
their taxonomic, geographic, and temporal coverage, and the appropriate
ways to retrieve, attribute and reproduce them. This document contains a
list of attributes of each Audubon Core term, including a documentation
name, a specified URI, a recommended English label for user interfaces,
a definition, and some ancillary notes. The version shown here has been
adopted by Biodiversity Information Standards / TDWG at the general
meeting in October 2013. This is a normative document and the definition
may not be changed without due process. A second version of Audubon
Core, [Audubon Core
Development](/wiki/Audubon_Core_Development "Audubon Core Development"),
will reflect the ongoing documentation changes and draft enhancements.

An Audubon Core (AC) record is a description of a multimedia resource
using the AC vocabularies. Two kinds of terms are specified by this
document: those terms which describe representation-independent aspects
of the media and those which describe representation-dependent aspects.
Most terms are representation-independent, referring to an "abstract
multimedia resource". One such term, *hasServiceAccessPoint*, refers to
or contains representation-dependent service access point metadata
describing a digital representation of the abstract multimedia resource.
These metadata describe such things as a web address at which a digital
representation can be retrieved, and the format, extent, or licenses
that describe a particular such representation. A multimedia resource
may provide several access points for different representations (e.g.,
different
resolutions).



## <span id="Borrowed_Vocabulary" class="mw-headline">Borrowed Vocabulary</span>

When terms are borrowed from other vocabularies, AC uses the URIs,
common abbreviations, and namespace prefixes in use in those
vocabularies. The URIs are normative, but abbreviations and namespace
prefixes have no impact except as an aid to reading the documentation.
Common such usage for abbreviations and namespace prefixes are Darwin
Core (DwC, dwc:), the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative(DC, comprising two
namespaces, with prefixes dc: and dcterms:), Adobe XMP (XMP, xmp:),
International Press and Telecommunications Council (IPTC, Iptc4xmpExt:),
the Exchangeable Image File Format (EXIF, exif:) and the TDWG Ontologies
Natural History Collection class (NCD, ncd:). Hypertext links in the
term table entries will bring the reader to appropriate documentation of
those
organizations.



## <span id="Namespaces.2C_Prefixes_and_Term_Names" class="mw-headline">Namespaces, Prefixes and Term Names</span>

The namespace of terms borrowed from other vocabularies is that of the
original. The namespace of de novo AC terms is
http://rs.tdwg.org/ac/terms/. In the table of terms, each term entry has
a row with the term name. This term name is generally an "unqualified
name" preceded by a widely accepted prefix designating an abbreviation
for the namespace It is recommended that implementers who need a
namespace prefix for the AC namespace use "ac". In this web document,
hovering over a term in the **[Index By Term
Name](#Index_By_Term_Name)** list below will reveal a complete URL that
can be used in other web documents to link to *this* document's
treatment of that term, even if it is from a borrowed vocabulary. It is
very important to note that some vocabularies, e.g those of the [Dublin
Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI)](http://dublincore.org/), provide
version of the same term in two different namespaces, one providing for
string values and one providing for URIs, even where that separation is
simply a recommendation, not a mandate. See this **[DCMI wiki
entry](http://wiki.dublincore.org/index.php/FAQ/DC_and_DCTERMS_Namespaces)**
on this topic. For vocabularies where such a practice is in place, we
often follow it and signal a reference in the Notes of our term
descriptions to the sister version of the term. An example is the pair
[dc:type](#dc:type) and [dcterms:type](#dcterms:type). When such a pair
allows repeated instances (e.g. as for [dc:source](#dc:source) and
[dcterms:source](#dcterms:source)), particular care may be required in
some implementations of AC, because some implementations may not provide
enough structure to clearly state the association between the members of
a pair in the case of multiple values of each. This is a special case of
the issue treated in the normative material on [Multiplicity and
Cardinality](/wiki/Audubon_Core_Structure#Multiplicity.2FCardinality "Audubon Core Structure").



## <span id="Layers" class="mw-headline">Layers</span>

The term set consists of two *Layers*, numbered *1* and *2*. The former
comprise the central terms, likely to be meaningful for most media, even
though only a few are mandatory. Implementers of AC representations
should provide for at least Layer 1 if possible, and application writers
should provide for robust treatment of Layer 1 terms, if only by
ignoring them. Layer 2 terms are more likely to be useful for particular
kinds of media or for applications requiring highly detailed resource
descriptions. Each term description below indicates the Layer to which
the term
belongs.



## <span id="Literal-_vs._URI-valued_Terms" class="mw-headline">Literal- vs. URI-valued Terms</span>

Some terms have two versions, one expecting a string literal value and
the other a URI. In these circumstances, the version expecting a string
is named with the suffix "Literal", e.g. ac:metadataLanguageLiteral. In
such cases, both forms may be provided, but care should be taken to
ensure that the uses reflect the same intent. In case of ambiguity, the
URI version prevails. All terms, including those whether or not with a
specific "Literal" suffix, specify in their definition whether the
required values are strings or
URIs.

http://purl.org/dc/terms/identifier

Label

Identifier

¬†

**Layer:** 1 ‚Äî **Required:** Yes for media collections, No for media
resources (but preferred if available). ‚Äî **Repeatable:** Yes

Definition:

An arbitrary code that is unique for the resource, with the resource
being either a provider, collection, or media item.

Defined
by:

[dcterms:identifier](http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/#terms-identifier)

Notes:

Using multiple identifiers implies that they have a same-as
relationship, i.e. they all identify the same object (e. g. an object
may have all of an http-URL, an lsid-URI, and a UUID).

<a name="Type"></a>Term Name: dc:type

Normative URI:

http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/type

Label

Type

¬†

**Layer:** 1 ‚Äî **Required:** Yes ‚Äî **Repeatable:** No

Definition:

dc:type may take as value any type term from the [DCMI Type
Vocabulary](http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-type-vocabulary/#H7).
Recommended terms are Collection, StillImage, Sound, MovingImage,
InteractiveResource, Text. Values may be used either in their literal
form, or with a full namespace (e. g.
http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/StillImage) from a controlled vocabulary,
but the best practice is to use the literal form when using dc:type and
use dcterms:type when you can supply the URI from a controlled
vocabulary and implementers may require this practice. At least one of
dc:type and dcterms:type must be supplied but, when feasible, supplying
both may make the metadata more widely useful. The values of each should
designate the same type, but in case of ambiguity dcterms:type prevails.

Defined by:

[dc:type](http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/type)

Notes:

A Collection should be given type "Collection" when using dc:type. If
the resource is a Collection, this item does *not* identify what types
of objects it may contain. Following the DC recommendations for [the
Text type](http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text), images of text should be
marked given as the string Text when provided as a string. **See also**
the entry for [**dcterms:type**](#dcterms:type) in this document and see
the **[DCMI FAQ on DC and DCTERMS
Namespaces](http://wiki.dublincore.org/index.php/FAQ/DC_and_DCTERMS_Namespaces)**
for discussion of the rationale for terms in two namespaces. Normal
practice is to use the same Label if both are provided. Labels have no
effect on information discovery and are only suggestions.

Term Name: dcterms:type

Normative URI:

http://purl.org/dc/terms/type

Label

Type

¬†

**Layer:** 1 ‚Äî **Required:** Yes ‚Äî **Repeatable:** No

Definition:

A full URI preferably from among the type URIs specified in the [DCMI
Type
Vocabulary](http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-type-vocabulary/#H7).
Recommended terms are those URIs whose labels are Collection,
StillImage, Sound, MovingImage, InteractiveResource, or Text (e.g.
http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Collection). Also recommended are the full
URIs of ac:PanAndZoomImage, ac:3DStillImage, and ac: 3DMovingImage.
Values MUST NOT be a string, but a URI with full namespace (e. g.
http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/StillImage) from a controlled vocabulary.
Implementers and communities of practice may determine whether specific
controlled vocabularies must be used. If the resource is a Collection,
this item does *not* identify what types of objects it may contain.
Following the DC recommendations at <http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text>,
images of text should be with this URI.

Defined by:

[dcterms:type](http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/#terms-type)

Notes:

Following the DC recommendations for [the Text
type](http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text), images of text should be given
as http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text when given as a URI. **See also**
the entry for [**dc:type**](#dc:type) in this document and see the

Subtype

¬†

**Layer:** 1 ‚Äî **Required:** No ‚Äî **Repeatable:** Yes

Definition:

The subtype should provide more specialization than the type. Possible
values are community-defined. For exmamples see the non-normative page
[AC\_Subtype\_Examples](/wiki/AC_Subtype_Examples "AC Subtype Examples").

Defined by:

[This item.](#subtypeLiteral)

Notes:

The subtypeLiteral term may not be applied to Collection objects.
However, the [Description](#Description) term in the Content Coverage
Vocabulary may add further description to a Collection object.

Term Name: ac:subtype

Normative URI:

http://rs.tdwg.org/ac/terms/subtype

Label

Subtype

¬†

**Layer:** 1 ‚Äî **Required:** No ‚Äî **Repeatable:** Yes

Definition:

Any URI may be used that provides for more specialization than the type.
Possible values are community-defined. For exmamples see the
non-normative page
[AC\_Subtype\_Examples](/wiki/AC_Subtype_Examples "AC Subtype Examples").

Defined by:

[This item.](#subtype)

Notes:

The subtype term may not be applied to Collection objects. However, the
[Description](#Description) term in the Content Coverage Vocabulary may
add further description to a Collection object. The subtype vocabulary
may be extended by users provided they identify the term by a URI which
is not in the ac namespace (for example, using
"http://my.inst.org/namespace/metadata/subtype/repair-manual").
Conforming applications may choose to ignore these. See
[ac:subtypeLiteral](#ac:subtypeLiteral) for usage with strings.

Term Name: dcterms:title

Normative URI:

http://purl.org/dc/terms/title

Label

Title

¬†

**Layer:** 1 ‚Äî **Required:** No ‚Äî **Repeatable:** No

Definition:

Concise title, name, or brief descriptive label of institution, resource
collection, or individual resource. This field should include the
complete title with all the subtitles, if any.

Defined by:

[dcterms:title](http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/#terms-title)

Notes:

It is **strongly** suggested to provide a title. The title facilitates
interactions with humans: e.g., it could be used as display text of
hyperlinks or to provide a choice of images in a pick list. The title is
therefore highly useful and an effort should be made to provide it where
it is not already available. When the resource is a collection without
an institutional or official name, but with a thematic content, a
descriptive title, e. g. ‚ÄúUrban Ants of New England,‚Äù would be suitable.
In individual media resources depicting taxa, the scientific name or
names of taxa often form a good title. Common names in addition to or
instead of scientific names are also acceptable. Indications of action
or roles captured by the media resource, such as predatory acts, are
desirable (‚ÄúRattlesnake eating deer mouse‚Äù, ‚ÄúPollinators of California
Native Plants‚Äù).

**Layer:** 2 ‚Äî **Required:** No ‚Äî **Repeatable:** Yes

Definition:

Date that the media resource was altered. The date and time must comply
with the World Wide Web Consortium ([W3C](http://www.w3.org)) [datetime
practice](http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime), which requires that date
and time representation correspond to ISO 8601:1998, but with year
fields always comprising 4 digits. This makes datetime records compliant
with
[8601:2004](http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=40874).
AC datetime values may also follow 8601:2004 for ranges by separating
two IS0 8601 datetime fields by a solidus ("forward slash", '/'). See
also the [wikipedia IS0 8601
entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) for further explanation
and examples.

Metadata Language

**Layer:** 1 ‚Äî **Required:** Yes ‚Äî **Repeatable:** No

Definition:

Language of description and other metadata (but not necessarily of the
image itself) represented as an ISO639-2 three letter language code.
ISO639-1 two-letter codes are permitted but deprecated.

Defined by:

[This item.](#metadataLanguageLiteral)

Notes:

This is NOT [dc:language](#dc:language), which is about the resource,
not the metadata. Metadata Language is deliberately single-valued,
imposing on unstructured serializations a requirement that multi-lingual
metadata be represented as separate, complete, metadata records. Audubon
Core requires that each record also contains the language-neutral terms.
In the absence of this requirement, metadata consumers would need to
know which terms are language-neutral and merge these terms from all
provided metadataLanguages into a single record. Metadata consumers may
re-combine the information based on the dcterms:identifier that
identifies the multimedia resource. At least one of ac:metadataLanguage
and ac:metadataLanguageLiteral must be supplied but, when feasible,
supplying both may make the metadata more widely useful. They must
specify the same language. In case of ambiguity, ac:metadataLanguage
prevails. Nothing in this document would, however, prevent an
implementer, e. g. of an XML-Schema representation, from providing a
fully hierarchical schema in which language neutral terms occur only a
single time, and only the language-specific terms are repeated in a way
that unambigously relates them to a metadata language. In RDF it may be
a simple repetition of plain literals associated with a language (e.g.,
xml:lang attribute in RDF/XML). The language attribute would then be
required in Audubon Core and would replace
[ac:metadataLanguage](#ac:metadataLanguage).

Notes:

The origin of the rating is not communicated. It may, e. g., be based on
user feedback or on editorial ratings. If Rating is not present, a value

Label

Date Available

¬†

**Layer:** 2 ‚Äî **Required:** No ‚Äî **Repeatable:** No

Definition:

The date (often a range) that the resource became or will become
available. The date and time must comply with the World Wide Web
Consortium ([W3C](http://www.w3.org)) [datetime
practice](http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime), which requires that date
and time representation correspond to ISO 8601:1998, but with year
fields always comprising 4 digits. This makes datetime records compliant
with
[8601:2004](http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=40874).
AC datetime values may also follow 8601:2004 for ranges by separating
two IS0 8601 datetime fields by a solidus ("forward slash", '/'). See

A use case is the harvesting of metadata published before the media are
available, which are pending a formal publication elsewhere. One
important example is the case of metadata that documents an occurrence,
which metadata harvesters might exploit without use of the media. See

Service Access Point

¬†

**Layer:** 1 ‚Äî **Required:** No ‚Äî **Repeatable:** Yes

Definition:

In a chosen serialization (RDF, XML Schema, etc.) the potentially
multiple service access points (e.g., for different resolutions of an
image) might be provided in a referenced or in a nested object. This
property identifies one such access point. That is, each of potentially
multiple values of hasServiceAccessPoint identifies a set of
representation-dependent metadata using the properties defined under the
section **[Service Access Point
Vocabulary](/wiki/Audubon_Core_Term_List#Service_Access_Point_Vocabulary "Audubon Core Term List")**.

Defined by:

[This item.](#hasServiceAccessPoint)

Notes:

Some serializations may flatten the model of service-access points by
(a) dropping ac:hasServiceAccessPoint, [ac:variant](#ac:variant) and
[ac:variantLiteral](#ac:variantLiteral), (b) repeating properties from
the [Service Access Point Vocabulary](#Service_Access_Point_Vocabulary)
and prefixing them with values of
[ac:variantLiteral](#ac:variantLiteral). If such a flat serialization is
necessary for services, we recommend to select from among term names of
the form "AB" where "A" is one of thumbnail, trailer, lowerQuality,
mediumQuality, goodQuality, bestQuality, offline and "B" is one of
AccessURI, Format, Extent, FurtherInformationURL, LicensingException,
ServiceExpectation (example: thumbnailAccessURI). Implementers in
specific constraint languages such as XML Schema or RDF may wish to make
Access URI and perhaps dcterms:format mandatory on instances of the
service access
point.

Notes:

Some providers use dc:publisher for this purpose, but it seems doubtful
that the publisher is by necessity the copyright owner. 'Public Domain'
is not an appropriate value because it denotes something that is not

Notes:

Example: "Available under Creative Commons BY-SA 3.0 license". This also
describes the commercial availability of items. Buying an identification
tool or media resource is essentially the purchase of an individual

**Layer:** 1 ‚Äî **Required:** No ‚Äî **Repeatable:** No

Definition:

Description of collection or individual resource, containing the Who,
What, When, Where and Why as free-form text. This normative document is
silent on the nature of formatting in the text. It is the role of
implementers of an AC concrete representation (e.g., an XML Schema, an
RDF representation, etc.) to decide and document how formatting advice
will be represented in descriptions serialized according to such
representations.

Defined
by:

[dcterms:description](http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/#terms-description)

Notes:

It optionally allows the presentation of detailed information and will
in most cases be shown together with the resource title. If both a
description and a caption are present in the metadata, a description is
typically displayed instead of the resource, whereas a caption is
displayed together with the resource. The description should aim to be a
good proxy for the underlying media resource in cases where only text
can be shown, whereas the caption may only make sense when shown
together with the media. Often only one of description or caption is
present; choose the term most appropriate for your metadata.

## <span id="Geography_Vocabulary" class="mw-headline">Geography Vocabulary</span>

All geography terms from the DarwinCore [version of 9
Dec 2009](http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/2009-12-07/terms/#dcterms) are deemed
included in the Core Layer. Specifically, this includes exactly those
which are declared by DarwinCore to be in DarwinCore Class
[Location](http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/2009-12-07/terms/#dcterms:Location).
Note that [dwc:locality](http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/locality) may be
used, but as applied to media this term may be ambiguous as to whether
it applies to the location depicted or the location at which the media
was created. When disambiguating information is available, it is better
to use the terms Location Shown and Location Created. The latter is in
the Resource Creation Vocabulary.

Location Created and Location Shown are separated in the current version
of IPTC, and the metadata working group (MWG
2010)<sup>[\[9\]](#cite_note-MWG2010-9)</sup> also recommends this. We
follow this below in order to support the expected future increase of
automatic GPS-based coordinate recording. As a special case, the AC
group recommends to change the semantics of Location Shown in the case
of biodiversity specimens, where the original location may differ from
the current location at which the specimen is held in a collection. In
this case, Location Shown should exclusively refer to the location where
a specimen was originally collected (gathering or sampling location).
Use Location Created to express the location where the resource was
created (a specimen was digitized).

Label

Temporal Coverage

¬†

**Layer:** 2 ‚Äî **Required:** No ‚Äî **Repeatable:** No

Definition:

The coverage (extent or scope) of the content of the resource. Temporal
coverage will typically include temporal period (a period label, date,
or date range) to which the subjects of the media or media collection
relate. If dates are mentioned, they should follow ISO 8601. When the
resource is a Collection, this refers to the temporal coverage of the
collection. Following
[dcterms:temporal](http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/#terms-temporal)
, the value must be a URI.

Defined
by:

[dcterms:temporal](http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/#terms-temporal)

Notes:

See the DCMI [User Guide dcterms:temporal
entry](http://wiki.dublincore.org/index.php/User_Guide/Publishing_Metadata#dcterms:temporal)
for an example. [dc:coverage](http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/coverage)
may be used for string values of temporal coverage, but use the
[Geography Vocabulary](#Geography_Vocabulary) for geographic coverage.
String examples for use with
[dc:coverage](http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/coverage) include
"Jurassic", "Elizabethan", "Spring, 1957". 2008-01-01/2008-06-30. If the
resource is video or audio, it refers to the time span, if any, depicted
by the resource. For live-media this is closely related to [Original
Date and Time](#Original_Date_and_Time) (Example: the time depicted by a
time-lapse video file of organism development), but for media with
fictional content it is not.

Original Date and Time

¬†

**Layer:** 1 ‚Äî **Required:** No ‚Äî **Repeatable:** No

Definition:

The date of the creation of the original resource from which the digital
media was derived or created. The date and time must comply with the
World Wide Web Consortium ([W3C](http://www.w3.org)) [datetime
practice](http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime), which requires that date
and time representation correspond to ISO 8601:1998, but with year
fields always comprising 4 digits. This makes datetime records compliant
with
[8601:2004](http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=40874).
AC datetime values may also follow 8601:2004 for ranges by separating
two IS0 8601 datetime fields by a solidus ("forward slash", '/'). See
also the [wikipedia IS0 8601
entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) for further explanation
and examples.

Notes:

What constitutes "original" is determined by the metadata author.
Example: Digitization of a photographic slide of a map would normally
give the date at which the map was created; however a photographic work
of art including the same map as its content may give the date of the
original photographic exposure. Imprecise or unknown dates can be
represented as ISO dates or ranges. Compare also Date and Time Digitized
in the Resource Creation Vocabulary. See also the [wikipedia IS0 8601

## <span id="Taxonomic_Coverage_Vocabulary" class="mw-headline">Taxonomic Coverage Vocabulary</span>

Term Name: ac:taxonCoverage

Normative URI:

http://rs.tdwg.org/ac/terms/taxonCoverage

Label

Taxon Coverage

¬†

**Layer:** 1 ‚Äî **Required:** No ‚Äî **Repeatable:** No

Definition:

A higher taxon (e. g., a genus, family, or order) at the level of the
genus or higher, that covers all taxa that are the primary subject of
the resource (which may be a media item or a collection).

Defined by:

<http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/Collection#taxonCoverage>

Notes:

Example: Where the subject of an image is several species of ducks with
trees visible in the background, Taxon Coverage would still be Anatidae
(and not Biota). Example: ‚ÄúAves‚Äù for a bird key or a bird image
collection. Do not add a rank (‚ÄúClass Aves‚Äù) in this field. Note that
this somewhat expands the usage of
[ncd:taxonCoverage](http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/Collection#taxonCoverage)
which, however has not yet been adopted by TDWG, and which specifies at
the Family level or higher. For collections it is recommended to follow
ncd:taxonCoverage to avoid conflicts between an AC record and a record
arising from use of the un-adopted NCD. If the resource contains a
single taxon, this should be placed in Scientific Taxon Name. In this
case Taxon Coverage may be left empty, but if not, care should be taken
that the entries do not conflict. Example: If Scientific Taxon Name is
*Quercus alba* then Taxon Coverage, if provided at all, should be
*Quercus*.

Term Name: dwc:scientificName

Normative URI:

http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/scientificName

Label

Scientific Taxon Name

¬†

**Layer:** 1 ‚Äî **Required:** No ‚Äî **Repeatable:** Yes

Definition:

Scientific names of taxa represented in the media resource (with date
and name authorship information if available) of the lowest level
taxonomic rank that can be applied.

Defined by:

[dwc:scientificName](http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/#scientificName)

Notes:

The Scientific Taxon Name may possibly be of a higher rank, e.g., a
genus or family name, if this is the most specific identification
available. Where multiple taxa are the subject of the media item,
multiple names may be given. If possible, add this information here even
if the title or caption of the resource already contains scientific
taxon names. Where the list of scientific taxon names is impractically
large (e.g., media collections or identification tools), the number of
taxa should be given in [Taxon Count](#Taxon_Count) (see below). If
possible, avoid repeating the [Taxonomic Coverage](#Taxonomic_Coverage)
here. Do not use abbreviated Genus names ("P. vulgaris"). It is
recommended to provide author citation to scientific names, to avoid
ambiguities in the presence of homonyms (the same name created by
different authors for different taxa). Identifier qualifications should
be supplied in the Identification Qualifier term rather than here (i. e.
‚ÄúAbies cf. alba‚Äù is deprecated, to be replaced with Scientific Taxon
Name = ‚ÄúAbies alba‚Äù and Identification Qualifier = ‚Äúcf. species‚Äù).

Term Name: dwc:identificationQualifier

Normative URI:

http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/identificationQualifier

Label

Identification Qualifier

¬†

**Layer:** 1 ‚Äî **Required:** No ‚Äî **Repeatable:** Yes

Definition:

A brief phrase or a standard abbreviation ("cf. genus", "cf. species",
"cf. var.", "aff. species", etc.) to express the determiner's doubts
with respect to a specified taxonomic rank about the identification
given in [Scientific Taxon Name](#Scientific_Taxon_Name).

Defined
by:

[dwc:identificationQualifier](http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/#identificationQualifier)

Notes:

Splitting identification qualification and [Scientific Taxon
Name](#Scientific_Taxon_Name) into separate fields is recommended
practice in cases where only a single taxon name is available, or if the
exchange format is able to keep relations between multiple names and
identification qualifiers. Where the exchange format only supports
simple multiplicities, a media item with multiple [Scientific Taxon
Names](#Scientific_Taxon_Name), some with, some without identification
qualifiers, may have to be transferred with "cf." or "aff." qualifiers
remaining embedded in the [Scientific Taxon
Name](#Scientific_Taxon_Name).

For discussion of Darwin Core usage see
[here](http://code.google.com/p/darwincore/wiki/Identification).

Example: For the determinations ‚Äúcf. Fusarium oxysporum f. sp.
palmarum‚Äù, ‚ÄúFusarium cf. oxysporum f. sp. palmarum‚Äù, ‚ÄúFusarium
oxysporum cf. f. sp. palmarum‚Äù the Scientific Taxon Name would always be
‚ÄúFusarium oxysporum f. sp. palmarum‚Äù, with Identification Qualifier ‚Äúcf.
genus‚Äù, ‚Äúcf. species‚Äù and ‚Äúcf. f.sp.‚Äù, respectively. In most cases only
the lowest taxon is in doubt, but cases exist where good reasons exist
to suspect a specific or even infraspecific determination, without
having a save generic identification.

Notes:

The primary purpose of this is in support of resource discovery, not
developing a taxonomic synonymy. Misidentification or misspellings may

Definition:

An exact or estimated number of taxa at the lowest applicable taxon rank
(usually species or infraspecific) represented by the media resource
(item or collection).

Defined by:

[This item.](#taxonCount)

Notes:

Primarily intended for resource collections and singular resources
dealing with sets of taxa (e. g., identification tools, videos). It is
recommended to give an exact or estimated number of specific taxa when a
complete list of taxa is not available or practical. The count should
contain only the taxa covered fully or primarily by the resource. For a
taxon page and most images this will be ‚Äú1‚Äù, i. e. other taxa mentioned
on the side or in the background should not be counted. However,
sometimes a resource may illustrate an ecological or behavioral entity
with multiple species, e. g., a host-pathogen interaction; taxon count
would then indicate the known number of species in this interaction.
This should be a single integer number. Leave the field empty if you
cannot estimate the information (do not enter 0). Additional taxon
counts at higher levels (e. g. how many families are covered by a
digital Fauna) should be given verbatim in the resource description, not
here.

Location Created

¬†

**Layer:** 1 ‚Äî **Required:** No ‚Äî **Repeatable:** Yes

Definition:

The location at which the media recording instrument was placed when the
media was created.

Defined by:

IPTC terms have URIs that are not resolvable, but AC follows the URI
namespace usage of the Adobe XMP implementation of IPTC terms described
in [IPTC Standard Photo Metadata
(July 2010)](http://www.iptc.org/std/photometadata/specification/IPTC-PhotoMetadata-201007_1.pdf).

Notes:

The distinction between the location shown and created is often
irrelevant, and metadata may be assumed to be referring to location
shown. It is recommended that the [Location Shown](#Location_Shown)
field above always be used when known. However, in the case of position
data automatically recorded by the instrument (e. g. EXIF GPS data)
[Location Created](#Location_Created) should be used to maintain
information accuracy. When one but not both of these locations are
present, AC is silent about whether the provided one entails the other.
A best practices document for a particular AC implementation might
address this.

**Layer:** 2 ‚Äî **Required:** No ‚Äî **Repeatable:** No

Definition:

Date the first digital version was created, if different from [Original
Date and Time](#Original_Date_and_Time) found in the [Temporal Coverage
Vocabulary](#Temporal_Coverage_Vocabulary). The date and time must
comply with the World Wide Web Consortium ([W3C](http://www.w3.org))
[datetime practice](http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime), which requires
that date and time representation correspond to ISO 8601:1998, but with
year fields always comprising 4 digits. This makes datetime records
compliant with
[8601:2004](http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=40874).
AC datetime values may also follow 8601:2004 for ranges by separating
two IS0 8601 datetime fields by a solidus ("forward slash", '/'). See
also the [wikipedia IS0 8601
entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) for further explanation
and examples.

Defined by:

[This item.](#digitizationDate)

Notes:

This is often *not* the media creation or modification date. For
example, if photographic prints have been scanned, the date of that
scanning is what this term carries, but Original Date and Time is that
depicted in the print. Use the international (ISO/xml) format
yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm (e. g. "2007-12-31" or "2007-12-31T14:59"). Where
available, timezone information should be added. In the case of digital
images containing EXIF, whereas the EXIF capture date does not contain
time zone information, but EXIF GPSDateStamp and GPSTimeStamp may be
relevant as these include time-zone information. Compare also MWG
(2010)<sup>[\[9\]](#cite_note-MWG2010-9)</sup>, which has best practice
advice on handling time-zone-less EXIF date/time data. See also the

[This item.](#resourceCreationTechnique)

Notes:

Examples: Encoding method or settings, numbers of channels, lighting,
audio sampling rate, frames per second, data rate, interlaced or
progressive, multiflash lighting, remote control, automatic interval
exposure.

Annotating whether and how a resource has been modified or edited
significantly in ways that are not immediately obvious to, or expected
by, consumers is of special significance. Examples for images are:
Removing a distracting twig from a picture, moving an object to a
different surrounding, changing the color in parts of the image, or
blurring the background of an image. Modifications that are standard
practice and expected or obvious are not necessary to document; examples
of such practices include changing resolution, cropping, minor
sharpening or overall color correction, and clearly perceptible
modifications (e.g., addition of arrows or labels, or the placement of
multiple pictures into a table.) If it is only known that significant
modifications were made, but no details are known, a general statement
like ‚ÄúMedia may have been manipulated to improve appearance‚Äù may be
appropriate.

Notes:

This is an alternative to ac:variant where using a string is preferred
over a URI. It is best practice to use ac:variant instead of
ac:variantLiteral wherever practical. Value may be free text, but it is
suggested to consider including terminology based on the following:  

  - Thumbnail: Service Access Point provides a thumbnail image, short
    sound clip, or short movie clip that can be used in addition to the
    resource to represent the media object, typically at lower quality
    and higher compression than a preview object. A typical size for a
    tiny thumbnail image may be 50-100 pixels in the longer dimension.
  - Trailer: Service Access Point provides video clip preview, in the
    form of a specifically authored "Trailer", which may provide
    somewhat different content than the original resource.
  - Lower Quality: Service Access Point provides a lower quality version
    of the media resource, suitable e. g. for web sites.
  - Medium Quality: Service Access Point provides a medium quality
    version of the media resource, e. g. shortened in duration, or
    reduced size, using lower resolution or higher compression causing
    moderate artifacts.
  - Good Quality: Service Access Point provides a good quality version
    of the media resource intended for resources displayed as primary
    information; e. g. an image between 800 and 1600 px in width or
    height.
  - Best Quality: Service Access Point provides the highest available
    quality of the media resource, whatever its resolution or quality
    level.
  - Offline: Service Access Point provides data about an offline
    resource.
