Munging notes 2018-10-31

Of the records in hasIdentifier, there are two that are not found in the master volume spreadsheet:
390550 and 390761

identified.csv includes the records in hasIdentifier, minus these two.

After the identified rows in master-volume.csv are removed, the remaining rows were put into unassociated.csv via the script remove-identifieds.py

The unassociated.csv rows were further screened by removing all of the unidentified records that had been successfully matched to the master volume spreadsheet.  This was done with the script remove-matches.py, which output the remaining records into the file orphaned.csv .

As far as I know, the XML files that I failed to match were in the folders /EAP255/Valle_del_Cauca, EAP640/Archivo_HistoÃÅrico_de_Mompox, and St_Aug .
