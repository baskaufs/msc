    "1. Obtain the list of words containing unique letters in unknown positions from the previously instantiated `Wordle_list` object. The first time it will be generated from the full five-letter word list from GitHub.\n",
    "2. Test the wordlist from using the `score_words_by_frequency()` function. \n",
    "2. Use the best scoring word as the guess and determine the guess results code (from the app or by using the default generated when the puzzle word is known).\n",
    "3. Instantiate a new `Wordle_list` object using the guess results code and the current wordlist, then go back to step 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The format of the guess results code is a string (in single quotes) with each of the letter result codes separated by commas and no spaces. Use uppercase letters if the guess was the right letter in the right position, lowercase if it was a right letter in the wrong position, and a lowercase letter preceded by a minus (`-`) character if it was a letter not found in the word. Example: `'B,-a,-n,-k,s'` if `banks` was guessed for the word `boost`\n",

    "Test words from Wordle answers in 2022 January from [here](https://screenrant.com/wordle-answers-updated-word-puzzle-guide/). The number following word is number of guesses required using the algorithm. To run the test yourself, set the value of `actual_word` to the word (in all lower-case).\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases, a stage was reached where there were two words with equal scores. In each case an additional guess would either be the correct answer, or eliminate the other possibility such that one additional guess would be required. Thus for a result of \"3 and 0.5\", after three guesses, there were two words with equal top scores. Guessing the right one would result in 4 guesses and guessing the wrong one would result in 5 guesses. \n",
