When disambiguating information is available, it is better to use the terms Location Shown and Location Created. The latter is in the Resource Creation Vocabulary.\\n\\nLocation Created and Location Shown are separated in the current version of IPTC, and the Metadata Working Group ([Metadata Working Group Guidelines for Handling Image Metadata, Version 2.0, November 2010](https://web.archive.org/web/20180919181934/http://www.metadataworkinggroup.org/pdf/mwg_guidance.pdf)) also recommends this. We follow this below in order to support the expected future increase of automatic GPS-based coordinate recording. As a special case, the AC group recommends to change the semantics of Location Shown in the case of biodiversity specimens, where the original location may differ from the current location at which the specimen is held in a collection. In this case, Location Shown should exclusively refer to the location where a specimen was originally collected (gathering or sampling location). Use Location Created to express the location where the resource was created (a specimen was digitized).\\n\\n','','','','','These terms are representation-dependent metadata, referring to specific digital representations of a resource (e.g., a specific resolution, quality, or format). They are used within whatever a particular AC implementation assigns to the value of `ac:hasServiceAccessPoint`, whose label is simply \"Service Access Point.\" Note that it is possible for an implementation to use syntactic conventions that avoid direct use of `ac:hasServiceAccessPoint`, as illustrated in the final example in the section [Multiplicity/Cardinality in the Audubon Core Structure document](structure.md#3-multiplicity-and-cardinality).\\n\\n']\n",

Metadata consumers may re-combine the information based on the dcterms:identifier that identifies the multimedia resource. Nothing in this document would, however, prevent an implementer, e. g. of an XML-Schema representation, from providing a fully hierarchical schema in which language neutral terms occur only a single time, and only the language-specific terms are repeated in a way that unambigously relates them to a metadata language.

Metadata Language is deliberately single-valued, imposing on unstructured serializations a requirement that multi-lingual metadata be represented as separate, complete, metadata records. Audubon Core requires that each record also contains the language-neutral terms. In the absence of this requirement, metadata consumers would need to know which terms are language-neutral and merge these terms from all provided metadataLanguages into a single record. Metadata consumers may re-combine the information based on the dcterms:identifier that identifies the multimedia resource. Nothing in this document would, however, prevent an implementer, e. g. of an XML-Schema representation, from providing a fully hierarchical schema in which language neutral terms occur only a single time, and only the language-specific terms are repeated in a way that unambigously relates them to a metadata language. In RDF it may be a simple repetition of plain literals associated with a language (e.g., xml:lang attribute in RDF/XML). The language attribute would then be required in Audubon Core and would replace ac:metadataLanguage.</td>\n",

The title facilitates interactions with humans: e.g., it could be used as display text of hyperlinks or to provide a choice of images in a pick list. The title is therefore highly useful and an effort should be made to provide it where it is not already available. When the resource is a collection without an institutional or official name, but with a thematic content, a descriptive title, e. g. \"Urban Ants of New England,\" would be suitable. In individual media resources depicting taxa, the scientific name or names of taxa often form a good title. Common names in addition to or instead of scientific names are also acceptable. Indications of action or roles captured by the media resource, such as predatory acts, are desirable (\"Rattlesnake eating deer mouse\", \"Pollinators of California Native Plants\").</td>\n",

When disambiguating information is available, it is better to use the terms Location Shown and Location Created. The latter is in the Resource Creation Vocabulary.\n",

      "Location Created and Location Shown are separated in the current version of IPTC, and the Metadata Working Group ([Metadata Working Group Guidelines for Handling Image Metadata, Version 2.0, November 2010](https://web.archive.org/web/20180919181934/http://www.metadataworkinggroup.org/pdf/mwg_guidance.pdf)) also recommends this. We follow this below in order to support the expected future increase of automatic GPS-based coordinate recording. As a special case, the AC group recommends to change the semantics of Location Shown in the case of biodiversity specimens, where the original location may differ from the current location at which the specimen is held in a collection. In this case, Location Shown should exclusively refer to the location where a specimen was originally collected (gathering or sampling location). Use Location Created to express the location where the resource was created (a specimen was digitized).\n",

Example: For the determinations \"cf. Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. palmarum\", \"Fusarium cf. oxysporum f. sp. palmarum\", \"Fusarium oxysporum cf. f. sp. palmarum\" the Scientific Taxon Name would always be \"Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. palmarum\", with Identification Qualifier \"cf. genus\", \"cf. species\" and \"cf. f.sp.\", respectively.

For collections it is recommended to follow ncd:taxonCoverage to avoid conflicts between an AC record and a record arising from use of the un-adopted NCD. If the resource contains a single taxon, this should be placed in Scientific Taxon Name. In this case Taxon Coverage may be left empty, but if not, care should be taken that the entries do not conflict.

For example, if photographic prints have been scanned, the date of that scanning is what this term carries, but Original Date and Time is that depicted in the print. In the case of digital images containing EXIF, whereas the EXIF capture date does not contain time zone information, but EXIF GPSDateStamp and GPSTimeStamp may be relevant as these include time-zone information.

Annotating whether and how a resource has been modified or edited significantly in ways that are not immediately obvious to, or expected by, consumers is of special significance. Examples for images are: Removing a distracting twig from a picture, moving an object to a different surrounding, changing the color in parts of the image, or blurring the background of an image. Modifications that are standard practice and expected or obvious are not necessary to document; examples of such practices include changing resolution, cropping, minor sharpening or overall color correction, and clearly perceptible modifications (e.g., addition of arrows or labels, or the placement of multiple pictures into a table.) If it is only known that significant modifications were made, but no details are known, a general statement like \"Media may have been manipulated to improve appearance\" may be appropriate.

Value may be free text, but it is suggested to consider including terminology based on the following: Thumbnail: Service Access Point provides a thumbnail image, short sound clip, or short movie clip that can be used in addition to the resource to represent the media object, typically at lower quality and higher compression than a preview object. A typical size for a tiny thumbnail image may be 50-100 pixels in the longer dimension. Trailer: Service Access Point provides video clip preview, in the form of a specifically authored \"Trailer\", which may provide somewhat different content than the original resource. Lower Quality: Service Access Point provides a lower quality version of the media resource, suitable e. g. for web sites. Medium Quality: Service Access Point provides a medium quality version of the media resource, e. g. shortened in duration, or reduced size, using lower resolution or higher compression causing moderate artifacts. Good Quality: Service Access Point provides a good quality version of the media resource intended for resources displayed as primary information; e. g. an image between 800 and 1600 px in width or height. Best Quality: Service Access Point provides the highest available quality of the media resource, whatever its resolution or quality level. Offline: Service Access Point provides data about an offline resource.</td>\n",
