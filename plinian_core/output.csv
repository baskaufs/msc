 DirectThreats,"Direct threats are the proximate human activities or processes that have caused, are causing, or may cause the destruction, degradation, and/or impairment of biodiversity targets (e.g., unsustainable fishing or logging). Direct threats are synonymous with sources of stress and proximate pressures. Threats can be past (historical), ongoing, and/or likely to occur in the future."

 IdentificationKeys,"Tool for the identification of organisms, comprising a series of steps, each of which represents a question about one or more characters of the organism. Each step offers multiple alternatives, choosing one of them will lead us to the next step until ending, finally, in the name of the organism. Most printed keys have only two alternatives, so called dichotomous keys.                                                      A taxon includes a key or an identification of key  in the subordinate taxons.
For example: 
If we are in a register of a genre, this register would include the keys of the species that this register includes, and if itÂ´s one specie, then it would include the key of the infraspecific rank (For plants: subspecies, variety forms)"
