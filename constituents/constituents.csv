Two were publishing ventures, specializing in Civil War views in partnership with William Huntington. Some time after 1884, Taylor had acquired a large collection of negatives by Matthew Brady, Alexander Gardner, and others previously in the posession of Col. Arnold A. Rand and Gen. Albert Ordway. Under the name of Taylor & Huntington, The War Photo & Exhibition Co., or his own name, he produced stereos and larger prints until at least 1903. An 1894 publication by The War Photograph & Exhibition Co. states that they have over 6,000 different views available. In 1907, the collection passed to Edward B. Eaton of Hartford, who embarked on his own publishing ventures with the images. After the death of Eaton in 1942, the Library of Congress acquired the collection."

2210,Edward Bailey Eaton,"American, 1870-1942","Eaton, Edward Bailey",American,1870,1942,"Edward Bailey Eaton was a journalist and publisher in Hartford, CT. In 1907, Eaton acquired thousands of negatives by Matthew Brady, Alexander Gardner, and others from John C. Taylor of Hartford, CT. From these, he published six books between 1907 and 1913, most notably the ten volume The Photographic History of the Civil War. On the 1910 census, Eaton was listed as ""Publisher- Patriot Publishing Co."", though an article from April 22, 1909 in the National Tribune stated that Eaton was to sell both the collection and the company to settle debts. It noted that the collection, ""weighing about three tons,"" was stored in ""fireproof vaults in Hartford"". The company seems to have relocated to Springfield, MA and retained Eaton as manager from 1910 to as late as 1918. Springfield directories indicate that he still lived in Hartford. By 1920, he had given up publishing and spent the rest of his life as a real estate agent. It seems that Eaton never sold the Brady collection, and it remained in the ""fireproof vaults"" where, according to the Library of Congress, ""it suffered its worst damage and destruction."" After Eaton's death in 1942, the Library of Congress acquired the collection for the cost of the unpaid storage."

After seeing Larry Kramer's 1985 play The Normal Heart, Giard set about to photograph gay and lesbian writers and activists. Against the backdrop of the escalating AIDS crisis and growing public hysteria, Giard sought out those from whom he derived strength and inspiration. The resulting archive includes significant figures from before the Stonewall era to his own contemporaries, and each image highlights the individuality of its subject. Aptly titled Particular Voices, Giard's photographs form a collective portrait, while resisting homogenizing or simplifying the gay and lesbian community. The New York Public Library began acquiring these portraits in 1990, adding to its already significant holdings of LGBTQ materials. MIT Press published a selection of these portraits in 1997, and the following year the New York Public Library mounted Particular Voices: Robert Giard's Portraits of Gay and Lesbian Writers, an exhibition of 110 prints from this collection."
